#To-Do list manager
deployed at https://johnbonanno.github.io/kadinceToDo/index.html


using Vanilla JavaScipt and HTML/CSS

Type in to-do items in the input field, and hit submit to add them to the to-do list.
You may mark a item as pending by clicking it once or as completed by clicking it twice.

Filter by pending items, completed items, or both completed and pending items by selecting the check boxes.
